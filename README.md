Training a RNN to learn spanish words from Don Quijote de la Mancha
## Description
This is a test on building a RNN to learn to finish spanish sentences from the book Don Quijote de la Mancha.</br>
At this point the model does not perform really well, not all the output words are even from spanish.</br>
In later versions of the proyect I'm willing to try different kinds of embedings and different models to see if they perform any better
## Requirements
- <b>Tensorflow</b> (built using tensorflow 2.1.0)
- <b>numpy</b>
- <b>matplotlib</b>
- <b>tqdm</b>
## References
This proyect was inspired by the lab1 on music generation with RNN by the MIT in the course <a href="http://introtodeeplearning.com/">introtodeeplearning.com</a>
